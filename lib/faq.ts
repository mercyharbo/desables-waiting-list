    title: 'What is Desables?',
    answer:
      'Desables is a neuroinclusive digital learning platform designed specifically for autistic and ADHD learners. We create structured, accessible pathways that help people build practical digital skills and progress toward real opportunities, without the overwhelm of traditional learning environments.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Who is Desables for?',
    answer:
      'Desables is built for autistic and ADHD learners who want to develop digital and creative skills in an environment designed to support focus, reduce friction, and honour individual learning rhythms. While anyone can explore Desables, neurodivergent experiences guide how the platform is designed',
  },
  {
    title: 'What types of skills will be covered?',
    answer:
      'Our initial learning pathways focus on practical, in-demand digital skills, including: Digital and visual design; UI/UX and accessibility-led design; Front-end and low-code development; Content creation and creative workflows. Each pathway is designed to build real capability, not just theoretical knowledge.',
  },
  {
    title: 'How is Desables different from other learning platforms?',
    answer:
      'Most learning platforms are designed around neurotypical assumptions, fast pacing, dense interfaces, competitive progress markers, and assessments that prioritise speed and conformity over real understanding.\n\nDesables is designed differently.\n\nFrom the outset, the platform is shaped by autistic and ADHD experiences, not retrofitted later. This means learning environments that respect different attention patterns, reduce unnecessary cognitive and sensory load, and allow learners to progress in ways that feel sustainable rather than overwhelming.',

  {
    title: 'What accessibility standards do you follow?',
    answer:
      'We design with recognised accessibility best practices in mind, including WCAG principles, but we don’t stop at technical compliance.\n\nAccessibility on Desables also means considering how people process information, manage attention, and experience sensory input. That includes predictable layouts, reduced cognitive load, flexible pacing, and multiple ways to engage with content.\n\nOur approach is guided by neurodivergent experiences and ongoing feedback, ensuring accessibility is practical, human, and effective, not just a checklist.',
